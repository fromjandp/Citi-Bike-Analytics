Analysis
1. The data shows top popular bike stations grouped in a closer proximity except one station. This station is
   the 'Sip Ave' station. While this could appear to be an outlier, the data shows that most of the rides, 
   from there, end at the VERY popular Grove St Path bike Station.
   
   I tried to take a look at the actual map of the Citi Bike Stations and found that 'Sip Ave' might actually be part of
   a separate group of bike stations and this station might be the connection between that group and the group of popular    locations shown in this analysis.
   
2. The data shows that while both males and females ride the bikes, the males are the majority of the riders.

3. The data shows that the subscriber base is much lower than that of the non-subscriber customer base. 
   The subscriber base looks to have a pike riding time of 8a and 6p which could be related to traveling 
   to work by bike around 8a and travel back  around 6p. More information would be needed here.
   
   The non-subscriber customer base looks to ride more consistently throughout the day and have the bike longer. Could 
   be touring or running errands. More information is needed here.
